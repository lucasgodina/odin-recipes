		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
			Asado is the name given to barbeques in South America, which are traditional
			social gatherings in Argentina, Chile, Uruguay and Paraguay. They tend to be
			held at weekends and can last for hours, with guests enjoying the social
			aspect as much as the food.
		</p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Chorizo sausage - 6</li>
			<li>Pork Sausages - 6</li>
			<li>Offal - 1lb</li>
			<li>Beef ribs - 2lbs</li>
			<li>Sirloin steak - 2lbs</li>
			<li>Salad - to serve</li>
			<li>Bread - to serve</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Make your side dishes in advance. Prepare fresh salads and a range of breads
				to be served with the meat, once cooked.
			</li>
			<li>Build a fire using a pile of wood and coal.</li>
			<li>
				Allow the wood to burn away, leaving hot coals. This may take around 30
				minutes.
			</li>
			<li>
				Set up the cast iron grill so it is approximately 8 inches above the coal.
			</li>
			<li>Chop the beef into your desired cuts and sprinkle it with salt.</li>
			<li>
				Place the larger cuts of meat onto the metal skewers, or straight on to the
				grill, first to give them longer to cook. They should be slowly cooked at a
				low temperature for at least two hours.
			</li>
			<li>Add your chorizo, offal and ribs to the grill.</li>
			<li>
				Make sure to turn the meat every 15-20 minutes to ensure even cooking.
			</li>
			<li>
				Cook these until the meat is cooked through and slightly charred on the
				outside, usually for 45 minutes to an hour.
			</li>
			<li>Allow to rest for a few minutes before serving.</li>
			<li>Serve your Asado meats with bread and salads on the side.</li>
		</ol>
