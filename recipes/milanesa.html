		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
			Milanesa is a popular Argentinian dish made from a breaded slice of meat,
			usually beef, that is fried in hot oil. This dish is usually served warm with
			a side of mashed potatoes, fries, or even a salad. While Milanesa is a
			typical Argentinian dish, the recipe actually originated all the way from
			Italy.

		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Beef round or tenderloin (thinly-sliced, about 1/2 inch thick) - 2 lb
			</li>
			<li>Eggs, beaten - 2</li>
			<li>Breadcrumbs - 1lb or 250g</li>
			<li>Garlic, chopped - 2 cloves</li>
			<li>Parsley, chopped - 3 tbsp</li>
			<li>Salt</li>
			<li>Black pepper</li>
			<li>Vegetable oil - Approximately 1 cup</li>
		</ul>
		<ol>
			<ul>
				Prepare the meat by removing the excess fat and nerves from the beef to get
				it clean as possible.
			</ul>
			<ul>
				Slightly pound the meat using a mallet to just under 1/4 inch thick.
			</ul>
			<ul>
				In a shallow bowl, whisk together the eggs, parsley and garlic. Season it
				with salt and pepper to taste.
			</ul>
			<ul>
				Dip the meat into the egg mixture and cover it with foil. Let it sit for 30
				minutes to an hour into the refrigerator. The more time it gets marinated,
				the better.
			</ul>
			<ul>
				Put in breadcrumbs on a plate to prepare for the meat.
			</ul>
			<ul>
				Once marination is done, take the meat out. Coat the meat with both sides
				with breadcrumbs and set aside.
			</ul>
			<ul>
				Pre-heat pan or skillet with vegetable oil over medium-high heat.
			</ul>
			<ul>
				Fry the meat for 2 minutes on each side or until golden brown. Keep in mind
				that the thinner the meat, the faster it cooks.
			</ul>
			<ul>
				Once done, take it out of the pan and serve it on a plate lined with paper
				towels to drain the oil. Serve it warm with a side course of your
				preference.
			</ul>
		</ol>
